# HTML Snips

Repository will be used for basic html templates. Main objective is to quick start with HTML projects by cutting time with initial setup. I will place common html template files.

## starter-template.html

Comes with basic but necessary meta tags and latest bootstrap source.

## reset.css

Copying it from http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/. It's an useful file to resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline.
